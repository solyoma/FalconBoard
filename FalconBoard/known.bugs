scribbles not the same as seen on screen, change when marked
moving marked blocks stutter
sometimes after load or in an new document nothing is shown until "paper" is scrolled
deleteing end of document sometimes? still moves down to that point when Ctrl+End is pressed
when pen colores redefined cursor color remains the same until not set again
If the space bar is pressed after F4 paste, and the @paper@ is moved then the rubberrect remains whee it was
and when after pressing the spacebar again you can move the block both the original rubberband and the new one 
remains and the original doesn't vanish
