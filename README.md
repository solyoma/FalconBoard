# MyWhiteboard

MyWhiteboard was created to help me with giving remote lectures during 
the coronavirus pandemic.

*Features*: 

   0. Works under Windows and Linux, and (I hope) on Macs too.
   1. System, dark and darker view modes
   2. Freehand drawing with four different (black/white, red, green, blue) color pens.
   3. Pen and eraser pen width is adjustable between 1 and 300 pixels.
   4. Unlimited Undo/Redo.
   5. "Unlimited" scrolling of page by keyboard (PgUp,PgDown,Home,Left,Right)
      mouse or tablet (press and hold space while using them).
   6. Usable with the mouse and with a graphic tablet.
   7. Keyboard shortcuts to most functions.
   8. Optional saving and loading sessions.
   9. Loading a background image: all drawings are on a different layer above the background
      as nice to have illustrations to comment on.
  10. Visible area can be printed and saved in many different image formats.
  11. Take a screenshot from any rectangular area of the desktop and load it as background image.
  12. Completely open source (GPL 3). 
      (used icons from PikaJian's Whitepad project https://github.com/PikaJian)
  13. Written in C++ with Qt 14.1 (multi platform).
  14. Both Visual studio project files and QtDesigner project files are included.
  
*Compilation*:

  It should compile with older (>5.6) Qt versions too, but I did not test it.
  - On Microsoft Windows you can  compile it with Visual Studio 2019/2017
    A project file *MyWhiteboard.sln* file is included for VS2-019
  - On MX Linux I used QtCreator.
