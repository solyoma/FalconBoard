# MyWhiteboard

MyWhiteboard is a program I created to help me with remote lectores during the coronavirus pandemic.

*Features*: 

  0. Works under Windows and Linux, and (I hope) on Macs too.
  1. Freehand drawing with four different (black, red, green, blue) color pens.
  2. Pen and eraser pen width is adjustable between 1 and 300 pixels.
  3. Unlimited Undo/Redo.
  4. Usable with the mouse and with a graphic tablet.
  5. Keyboard shortcuts to most functions.
  4. Saving and Loading sessions.
  5. Loading a background image: all drawings are on a different layer above the background
     nice to have illustrations to comment on.
  6. Visible image can be saved in many different image format.
  7. Take a screenshot from any rectangular area of the desktop and load it as background image.
  8. Written in C++ with Qt 14.1
  9. Both Visual studio project files and QtDesigner project files included.
  10. Completely open source. (used icons from PikaJian's Whitepad project https://github.com/PikaJian)
  
*Compilation*:

  This is a source only version (for the time being) so you need to have Qt and a compiler to use it. 
  It should compile with older (>5.6) Qt versions too, but I did not test it.
  - On Microsoft Windows compile it with Visual Studio 2019 A project file *MyWhiteboard.sln* file is included
  - On MX Linux I used QtCreator.
